# README - Information Extraction (IE) System for Text Data

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an **Information Extraction (IE) System** for processing and extracting valuable insights from text data. The system applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to identify, categorize, and retrieve relevant information from raw text sources. 

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies entities such as names, locations, organizations, and dates.
- **Relation Extraction:** Determines relationships between identified entities.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Identifies key terms and concepts from the text.
- **Summarization:** Generates concise summaries from large text documents.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines the sentiment of the extracted information.
- **Data Storage:** Stores extracted data in a structured format (JSON, CSV, or database).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `spaCy` for NLP processing
  - `NLTK` for text preprocessing
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for sentiment analysis
  - **Jupyter Notebook** for development and testing
  - `SQL/NoSQL databases` for data storage

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IE-System.git
   cd IE-System
   ```
2. **Install dependencies in Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage in Jupyter Notebook
1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Load the notebook:** Open `IE_System.ipynb`.
3. **Run the cells step by step** to process and extract information from text data.
4. **Provide input text:** Upload or paste raw text data into the system.
5. **Process & Extract Information:** The system processes the text and outputs structured information.
6. **View Results:** Extracted data is displayed in the notebook or saved to a file/database.

## Example Input & Output
### Input:
```
Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States and was born in Hawaii.
```
### Output:
```json
{
  "Entities": {
    "Person": ["Barack Obama"],
    "Location": ["Hawaii"],
    "Organization": ["United States"]
  },
  "Relations": [
    {"subject": "Barack Obama", "relation": "was the President of", "object": "United States"}
  ]
}
```

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the accuracy of entity recognition with domain-specific models.
- Implement real-time processing for streaming text data.
- Integrate with external APIs for broader information retrieval.
